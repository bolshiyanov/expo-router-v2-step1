Empowering Creation: Crafting a Search-Optimized React-Native Website with expo-router v2

In this tutorial, we embark on a step-by-step journey to construct a static website on React-Native using expo-router v2. Our goal is to build a website builder and mobile app constructor all in one, with maximum search optimization. The project itself spans a considerable scope, encompassing a Multilingual Website Constructor, user registration, payment capabilities, and an array of other features.

In the upcoming chapters, we will establish the foundation of this site's structure and introduce a multitude of navigational possibilities. As we progress, we'll lay the groundwork for seamless navigation and explore the potential for dynamic, user-centric experiences.

## 📚 About this step


## 🗺 Project Layout

- [`packages`](/packages) All the source code for Expo modules, if you want to edit a library or just see how it works this is where you'll find it.
- [`apps`](/apps) This is where you can find Expo projects which are linked to the development modules. You'll do most of your testing in here.
- [`docs`](/docs) The source code for **https://docs.expo.dev**
- [`templates`](/templates) The template projects you get when you run `npx create-expo-app`
- [`react-native-lab`](/react-native-lab) This is our fork of `react-native` used to build Expo Go.
- [`guides`](/guides) In-depth tutorials for advanced topics like contributing to the client.
- [`android`](/android) contains the Android project.
- [`home`](/home) contains the JavaScript source code of the app.
- [`ios`](/ios) contains the iOS project.
- [`ios/Exponent.xcworkspace`](/ios) is the Xcode workspace. Always open this instead of `Exponent.xcodeproj` because the workspace also loads the CocoaPods dependencies.
- [`tools`](/tools) contains build and configuration tools.
- [`template-files`](/template-files) contains templates for files that require private keys. They are populated using the keys in `template-files/keys.json`.
- [`template-files/ios/dependencies.json`](/template-files/ios/dependencies.json) specifies the CocoaPods dependencies of the app.
